- 👋 Hi, I’m @KatProgram aka Kat!
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, I love analysing and playing with data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different visualisation softwares, such as PowerBI. 
- 💞️ In my free time, I dabble a lot in Google platforms to make interactive spreadsheets for the video games I play.
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord at @demon_4
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I spent 2 days straight creating an inventory system, which had also crafting and manual inputs, as well as a colour cordinated system for ingredients, which was all automatic for a FiveM server for my friends and I.
